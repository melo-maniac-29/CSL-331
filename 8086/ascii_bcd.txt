/*************  âœ¨ Codeium Command ðŸŒŸ  *************/
; This code takes an ASCII character from memory address 2050, converts it to a BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) number, and stores the result in memory address 3050.
convert ascii to bcd

; First, the ASCII character is loaded into the AL (lower byte of AX) register.
5000 :: MOV AL,[2050]

; The AND instruction is used to clear the upper 4 bits of the ASCII character.
; The mask 0F (00001111b) is used to clear the upper 4 bits, leaving only the lower 4 bits of the ASCII character.
; This is done because the ASCII character is represented using 8 bits, but the BCD number that we want to convert it to is represented using only 4 bits.
; For example, the ASCII character '5' is represented as 0x35, but the BCD number 5 is represented as 0x05.
; So, we use the AND instruction to clear the upper 4 bits of the ASCII character, leaving only the lower 4 bits that represent the BCD number.
        AND AL,0F

; The result of the AND instruction is stored in memory address 3050.
        MOV [3050],AL

; The program is halted using the HLT instruction.
        HLT
