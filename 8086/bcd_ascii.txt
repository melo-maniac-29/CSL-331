/*************  âœ¨ Codeium Command ðŸŒŸ  *************/
; This code takes a BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) number from memory address 2000 and converts it to an ASCII character.
; The ASCII character is then stored in memory address 3000.
bcd to ascii convertion

; The value at memory address 2000 is moved into register AL.
MOV AL,[2000]

; The value in AL is moved into AH.
MOV AH,AL

; The AND instruction is used to clear the upper 4 bits of the BCD number.
; The mask 0F (00001111b) is used to clear the upper 4 bits, leaving only the lower 4 bits of the BCD number.
; This is done because the BCD number is represented using 8 bits, but the ASCII character that we want to convert it to is represented using only 4 bits.
; For example, the BCD number 5 is represented as 0x05, but the ASCII character '5' is represented as 0x35.
; So, we use the AND instruction to clear the upper 4 bits of the BCD number, leaving only the lower 4 bits that represent the ASCII character.
; The result of the AND instruction is stored in AL.
AND AL,0F

; The value in AH is shifted right by 4 bits.
; The CL register is used as the count register for the shift instruction.
; The SHR instruction is used to shift the value in AH to the right.
; The result of the shift instruction is stored in AH.
MOV CL,04
SHR AH,CL

; The OR instruction is used to combine the values in AL and AH.
; The result of the OR instruction is stored in AX.
; The value in AX is now the ASCII character that we want to convert the BCD number to.
; The ASCII character is then stored in memory address 3000.
OR AX,3030
MOV [3000],AX

; The program is halted using the HLT instruction.
